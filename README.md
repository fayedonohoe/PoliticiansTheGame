# PoliticiansTheGame
Christmas Assignment for Object Orientated Programming - Recreate a Classic Game

Concept:
A twist on a classic! The politician must collect apples and coins to survive!

How To:
Click your way through the menu until you choose a game mode. Then use the arrow keys to navigate arround but aviod the edges!
Every apple is worth 10 points and every coin is worth 25.

Points of Interest:
Use of classes and inheritence, 
Use of array lists (for the politician), 
Polymorphism (GameObject Class is extended by both Politician and Food), 
Humour, 
Room for expansion to continue on as a personal project - loads more ideas to impliment!


Video Demonstration:
Please note that this was the sixth attempt at recording as the recorder was acting up. 
The gameplay was captured however the bottom of the gameplay screen (with the rising score) was cut off.
